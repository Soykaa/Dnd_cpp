# Dungeons and Dragons

Google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4Ri1zWtjhze8bRNkX-s8R6mnI4sOrut0yR1rkC9gTQ

Used library: Qt 5.9.9

Game assembly instructions:
1) Move to `DnD_cpp/DnD/build`
2) Enter `cmake ..`, then `make`
3) Run execution file: `./DnD`

**Note:** in some rare cases one of the players can stop his moves over the game field.
We didn't find source of the problem. If it occurs, project re-assembly can be the solution.
Thanks for understanding.
